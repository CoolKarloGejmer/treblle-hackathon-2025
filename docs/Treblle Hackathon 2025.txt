Bazni dio zadatka
Problem koji rješavate je prikaz API request-ova za jedan API po vašem izboru. Samo
rješenje mora imati full git flow, mora imati zasebni repo za FE i BE, te koristimo REST
API dizajn API-ja.
Samo rješenje mora podržavati:
● list view
○ Method
○ Response
○ path
○ response time
○ Created at
● table view
○ Method
○ Response
○ path
○ response time
○ Created at
● sort by
○ Created at
○ response time
● filter
○ Method
○ response
○ time (response time or created at or both)
● search function
● define a Problem object for an API within your application and apply the same
base requirements as list view, table view, sort and filter. You decide what should
be visible for each, depending on your definition of a problem object.
